## Set Up

Setting up Bamazon is pretty easy. You will need to download a couple things first:

* [MySQL Workbench] (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench)

Once you've downloaded the git repo, open it and use the command line to `cd` to the root of the file. You'll know you are at the root if you see this readme and the file `bamazonCustomer.js`.
